I'm building a complex data dashboard with multiple charts and filters. I need to think about:

- Component architecture and hierarchy
- State management strategy (Redux vs Context vs local state)
- Data fetching and caching
- Performance considerations

I've built dashboards before and usually use a standard pattern, but I want to make sure I'm considering the right things for this specific project.

What should I think about architecturally?
