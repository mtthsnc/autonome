I have a design for a new blog platform from our brainstorm session. Before I start implementing, I want to validate that the architecture is sound.

The design includes:
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Node.js backend with Express
- PostgreSQL database
- API for posts, comments, and user management

Should I think about the architecture here?
